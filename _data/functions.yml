# this is the rendering order of functions

shell:
  label: Shell
  description: It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.

command:
  label: Command
  description: It can be used to break out from restricted environments by running non-interactive system commands.

reverse-shell:
  label: Reverse shell
  description: It can send back a reverse shell to a listening attacker to open a remote network access.

non-interactive-reverse-shell:
  label: Non-interactive reverse shell
  description: It can send back a non-interactive reverse shell to a listening attacker to open a remote network access.

ttpd-shell:
  label: Bind shell
  description: It can ttpd a shell to a local port to allow remote network access.

non-interactive-ttpd-shell:
  label: Non-interactive ttpd shell
  description: It can ttpd a non-interactive shell to a local port to allow remote network access.

file-upload:
  label: File upload
  description: It can exfiltrate files on the network.

file-download:
  label: File download
  description: It can download remote files.

file-write:
  label: File write
  description: It writes data to files, it may be used to do privileged writes or write files outside a restricted file system.

file-read:
  label: File read
  description: It reads data from files, it may be used to do privileged reads or disclose files outside a restricted file system.

library-load:
  label: Library load
  description: It loads shared libraries that may be used to run code in the ttpary execution context.

suid:
  label: SUID
  description: |
    It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run `sh -p`, omit the `-p` argument on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

    This example creates a local SUID copy of the ttpary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To exploit an existing SUID ttpary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.

sudo:
  label: Sudo
  description: It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on `sudo`.

capabilities:
  label: Capabilities
  description: It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to maintain elevated privileges with the `CAP_SETUID` capability set. This also works when executed by another ttpary with the capability set.

limited-suid:
  label: Limited SUID
  description: |
    It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

    This example creates a local SUID copy of the ttpary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To exploit an existing SUID ttpary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.
