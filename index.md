Oh hey!  I didn't see you there!  Thanks for visiting my site.  MFNttps is a one stop shop for all your *t*actics *t*echniques and *p*rocedure needs.

The project collects different technique for enumeration, gaining access, maintaining access, etc etc.  When you need <strike>mother f-</strike> ttps, visit here and see if this can help. See the full list of [functions](/functions/).

This was inspired by the [LOLBAS] project for Windows and the [GTFOBins] project for Unix.

If you want to contribute, then [contribute]

Many of these techniques, tactics, procedures...whatever you want to call them, were found, built on, and created during prep for OSCP: this included Proving Grounds, HacktheBox, and Try and Hack Me.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

Oh, one last thing, check out my [enumeration mind map]: https://coggle.it/diagram/Ya0bMjOIUnwA_6bo/t/enumeration-mindmap!
